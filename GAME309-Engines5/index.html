    <H1> Welcome to Game 309 - Game Engines 5 </H1>
    <p>
        In this course, we will cover approximately 10-12 topics at a rate of one per week.
        I will give you 10% of your grade for each topic that you demonstrate strong knowledge in.
        As you are in your final year, I hope that you will apply these ideas in your
        capstone project so that you do not have to create separate demonstration programs.
        The goal is to make your capstone project stand out.
    </p>

    <p>
        As each topic is worth 10%, you can choose how many of these ideas you want to implement.
        Therefore, you have the opportunity to choose your own grade by demonstrating
        strong knowledge in the number of topics that you select.
    </p>

            Topic 0 (max 10%): Required <br />

                Topic 1 (max 10%): Memory Monitor<br />   
                For full credit, keep track of all the heap allocations and deallocations by overloading
                the new and delete operators and gather data.
                Some ideas are, but not limited to, count the number of allocations and deallocations,
                sum the amount mem allocated and subtrack the amount deallocated looking for memory leaks.
                Can you give me some statistics about memory allocation and deallocation I can use to analysize 
                a program.

                Topic 2 (max 10%): Memory Management<br />
                Memory management in game programming is the process of allocating, freeing and managing memory efficiently to ensure the
                proper execution of a game. This includes handling memory allocation for game assets such as textures, audio files,
                and models, as well as managing memory used by the game engine and game objects. Effective memory management is crucial
                for achieving optimal performance, avoiding crashes in large game productions. Common techniques used in game memory management
                include pooling, garbage collection, distinct memory block allocations.
                <a class="nav" href="https://www.swedishcoding.com/2008/08/31/are-we-out-of-memory/"> Cool old article on memory allocation </a><br />
                To get full credit for this topic, put the memory management tecgniques discussed in class into an existing program
                and demonstrate that you can control the use of memory over just using the OS.

                For full credit, the secondary threads must perform a meaningful task.
                If the threads share objects in memory, the use of <code>mutexes</code>
                (a synchronization object) should be considered to prevent race conditions.
                Here are some ideas for tasks that the secondary threads could perform:

        Topic 4 (max 10%): Profiling <br />

         Profiling tools are already installed since VS2022. Let me show you a little on geting started analyzing your C# or C++ code. 
         Yup, I said C#.<br />
         There's technical publications from Microsoft out there on how to use their profiling (diagnostics report) tools but I find 
         them unclear. There are a set of (really bad) videos from Microsoft on YouTube, in my opinion, they talk a lot and say very 
         little. Just skip to this link
         <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1-uHpEqNGM&list=PLReL099Y5nRf2cOurn1hI-gSRxsdbC27C&index=4">Profiling CPU usage</a> <br />
         Use these tools look at what your capstone is doing over time.<br />

         Problem is you all code too clean and our projects are too small for this type of profiling to be of any use. I just want you to know it 
         exists. <br/>

         Another way to do timing is to do it yourself. In class, I talked about std::chrono, we saw it first in the Threads topic.<br/>
         Using this tool, you can create your own timing calls to evaluate the performance of your code. <br/>
         There is a guy on youTube has a game engine series (TheCherno), and I really like his work. Secretly, I think he steals my good ideas. Ha! <br />
         Cherno does a really good job of creating some timer wrappers in this video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbYV8rRo9_A">Intro to Profiling.</a><br/>

         
         This is my version of the timing/profiling code - much better I think, of course.<br/>

        Topic 5 (max 10%): Adding a Game Controller<br />
        Human Interface Device (HID) is a standarized way communicating with USB devices, it's not just games controllers - wake up. 
        When a USB device is plugged into a Windows machine, the OS identifies the device by asking for a set of ID bytes. Given this info, the 
        OS looks on the network for a driver. You have probably seen this when you plug a new device into your system. <br/><br/>

        The current most popular controllers are PlayStation(Sony) and Xbox(Microsoft). <br/>
        In class I will discuss the differences between them and walk you through some of the toolkits that are out there out there. <br/>

                Topic 6 (max 10%): Audio <br />
                Creating audio without tools is very difficult and requires a knowledge of 3D-audio physics beyond the scope of out program.<br />
                Therefore, I recommend using a pre-made library:<br />

                <a href="https://https://www.ambiera.com/irrklang/"> IrrKlang </a> This is my favorite library. It's very complete, I'll demo it in class<br /><br />
                <a class="nav" href="../CodeDepot/AudioIrrklang.zip"> Example code: AudioIrrklang </a><br/>
                

                <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/"> SDL_mixer </a> This is a primitive audio library that cannot handle too many audio clips being played at the same time but it's easy to use and great for backgound music.As you may know, Limbo is my favorite
                video game from my grogramming and artistic perspective. I love the background music so much, I bought it, check it out in the panel on the right. <br /><br />

                <a href="https://www.openal.org/"> OpenAl - Open Audio Library </a> This offers more features than SDL_mixer. It is free and open source (and a little old) - I dare you to look into it. <br /><br />
                <a href="https://www.fmod.com/"> FMod - FMOD is a proprietary sound effects engine developed by Firelight Technologies </a> This is very much one of the standards in gaming. To download it you must register with them,
                to use it commercially, you must pay them. It is very complete for 3D sounds and music. It can hook into Unity, Unreal or in your stand-alone applications. Warning: it is a big API, there is a large learning curve associated with it. <br />
                <br />

        Topic 8 (max 10%): Frustum Culling <br />
        Oops, we did this last week along with the audio stuff<br />

       <p>
           Topic 9 (max 10%): File IO and Data Serialization: Saving Game States Efficiently and other stuff<br />
           More that just reading or writing to a file, I will show you serialize C++ objects and write them to file
           system such that those objects can be recreated at a later time. Ask you networking teacher about that. 

           I will also discuss how all the file systems work: FAT, NTSF, UNIX, and ReFS. 
       </p>

<li>
  <p>
     Topic 10 (max 10%): Unreal, Unity Plug-ins and DLLs<br />
       Plug-ins are nothing more than a DLL written in C/C++ (unmanaged memory) or even C# (managed memory). <br />
        There are two parts the process (1) build the DLL and (2) create the C# script in Unity that uses it. <br />
        I'll show you how to create a dll in C/C++ in class, it's easy, but there is some explaining I must do.<br />
    A very good conference talk about DLLs was at CppCon 2017 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPQWQfDhICA">Everything You Ever Wanted to Know about DLLs</a><br />
    <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/NativePlugins.html">How to work with native plug-in in Unity</a> <br />
